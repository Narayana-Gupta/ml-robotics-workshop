Robots are machines designed to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously, often mimicking human motion. The key components of a robot include:  
1. Mechanical Structure – Typically modeled after the human arm, consisting of cantilevered links and hinged joints for flexibility and dexterity.  
2. Controllers – Systems that process instructions, using numerical control or advanced algorithms to guide movements.  
3. Sensors – Devices that help the robot monitor its surroundings and itself, such as vision systems, touch sensors, and joint encoders.  
4. Actuators – Motors or mechanisms that generate movement in response to controller signals.  

Together, these components allow robots to perform tasks with precision, adaptability, and autonomy.  

Three applications of robotics in the real world include:  
1. Industrial Automation – Robots are widely used for assembly, welding, and material handling on production lines, improving efficiency and flexibility.  
2. Medical Surgery – Robots assist in minimally invasive surgeries, offering greater precision and reducing recovery time for patients.  
3. Space Exploration – Robots like the Mars Rover explore planets, navigate rough terrains, and conduct experiments in environments unsuitable for humans.  

From factories to hospitals and outer space, robotics continues to transform industries, performing tasks that extend human capabilities while ensuring safety and efficiency.
